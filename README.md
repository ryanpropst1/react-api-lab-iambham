###  In this lab assignment, your primary objective is to request data from a third-party API, handle the response, and then display the data in the browser.

-The API we will start with is the Studio Ghibli API (https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/). If you visit that website, you will be able to see what a traditional API explorer looks like. Spend a few minutes familiarizing yourself with the website, and see if you can determine what endpoints are exposed in the API.

- When reading the requirements below, think about what kind of user interface this will be, and how many components you may need in order to accomplish these tasks. Which components have state and which ones can just rely on props? Before you jump right into the lab, consider how you will need to organize your application now that you have data being brought in from an API.

## PART ONE
- Your first task is to retrieve all films from this API, and then parse the response to display a "card" for each film. You will need to use the fetch method in order to do this, and you should invoke fetch when the component is mounted to the application.

- Consider styling your card at this point so that it is easier to read. Bootstrap 4 should make this pretty easy for you.

- At a minimum, you should display the film title and description, but you may use as many properties as you want.

## PART TWO
- Your second task is to conditionally render films. More specifically, you should be able to manually "load" the films with a button click.

- When the project first compiles, the only thing you should see is the Studio Ghibli logo image and a button with the text "Load Films". Upon clicking the button, the films should load and be displayed on the screen.

** Hint: your fetch method from Phase One does not need to change in order to complete this section. Instead, consider toggling a property in state with the button click.

## PART THREE
- Your third task is to combine both objectives from Phase One and Two in order to conditionally load data from another endpoint in the Studio Ghibli API. Furthermore, you may only make one HTTP request at a time.

- For example, you may choose to load Films or People with a button for the respective endpoint, which means the project should only display two buttons (one for "Load Films", one for "Load People") when it first loads. The data loaded, and therefore rendered, depends on which button is pressed.

- At a minimum, if you choose the "People" endpoint, you should display the person's name, age, gender, and a link to that particular person's JSON response that will open in a new tab, but you may use as many properties as you want. If you choose something else as your second endpoint, just be sure to display at least two properties in addition to opening up the link to the item's ID in a new tab.

### BONUS
- Use the knowledge gained from the routing tutorials to break your project up into pages/routes. Example, you could now have a main landing page, and then a separate route for films, people, etc.
